"""
short_term.py — Rolling short-term message buffer.

Real need this solves in Meridian Port Authority:
An MCP session is one shift. Dispatchers, customs officers and supervisors
exchange dozens of tool-heavy turns (status checks, hold lookups, release
requests) in a single session. We keep only the most recent N turns in full
detail so prompts stay small — but we must never silently lose the thing the
agent is actively working on. That's why scratchpad.py is a deliberately
separate object: pruning this buffer must never be able to touch it.
